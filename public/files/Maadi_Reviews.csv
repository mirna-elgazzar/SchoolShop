Noor Language Schools,Salem MUSTAFA,"Nothing,  they make you pay 16 thousand and you get nothing in return. My daughter stayed sick at home for two weeks and no one called to check on her  why she was absent. They charge you over a thousand EGP for the books. They portray themselves as a school with religious beliefs yet they don't apply those beliefs in daily life and they are masters in overcharging the parents. The school bus teacher only showed once every week,  most of the time my daughter was escorted by an older child out of the bus.You have to pay them the first installment before the beginning of the new school year. when I decided to transfer my daughter  to a better school, They deducted 10 % out of my refund as a penalty for withdrawing from their horrible school. and get this, they deducted 10% out of the entire year fee (the 16000) and not just the first installment . even though the school year hadn't started yet by then.
