St. Fatima Language School,Ahmed M AbdelMutea,"I have graduated from Saint Fatima school IGCSE school almost 6 years ago. From an educational perspective , I would.totally.recommend the school for IGCSE students aiming for high grades. There was a lot of professional teachers in most subjects and the office hours offered helped me.not to.take any private lessons. The school is generally clean and classes are well-equipped,however, it's too overcrowded for its size. My only concern before entering school was the reputation of fights between students but the school.took strong measures towards this by hiring bodyguards and a private security agency. The school however lacks amenities other IGCSE schools with similar price could have.",4,en,a week ago
