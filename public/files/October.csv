History / Profile

The Promise of a Good EducationThe Egyptian American International School (EAIS) – the American Division of the Egyptian Language School (ELS) – was first accredited in 2003 and holds accreditation from NCA-CASI, a division of Advanc-Ed.
Since its birth EAIS has followed the ELS mission “teach for life” to prepare students for higher education, employment, and beyond. In each grade level from KG1 through grade 12, our teachers advise, assist, monitor, and motivate our students. The faculty is comprised of dedicated and professional qualified American and foreign teachers.

Curriculum &amp; Assessment The curriculum throughout the stages is based on US National Standards in association with Egyptian National Standards in Science and Math. Our American Curriculum is followed by using American textbooks and International resources. All courses are designed to allow students maximum application of topics developing their personalities, creativity, logical, analytical and critical thinking.
In addition to a full course load, students are also given intense preparation for the SAT examination, giving them the full qualifications to apply to both local and international universities.
In addition to continuous assessment the school administers two Mid-Semester Exams and 2 Semester examinations per year. Additionally, the MAP (Measured Academic Progress) Test is administered to all our students from grades 2 to 10- two times a year (fall/ spring) to assess their performance against their peers as well as their progress throughout the year.

Grading Students are graded based on various forms of assessment, class participation, homework, classwork, projects, and behavior. EAIS believes in a well rounded student and gives a variety of opportunities to allow students to shine.

Academic Support Teachers and administrators will convene on a regular basis to determine students who need to be placed on an academic support program. These students will be closely monitored as well as given additional extra help in the subjects needed.

Promotion to the Next Grade Level Students must receive a passing grade of 60% (D-) or higher in all subjects in order to be promoted to the next grade level. Arabic, Religion, and Arabic Social Studies passing grades are from 50% as per the Ministry.
A grade of F in 1 or 2 subjects will result in a re-exam in the subjects failed. The date of the re-exam will be determined by the school administration and cannot be rescheduled. Failure to attend re-examination will result in a grade of F. Passing the re-exam will result in a passing mark of 60% (D-). Failing the re-exam will result in an F.
A grade of F in 3 or more subjects will result in the repetition of the year. 

Graduation Requirements &amp; the SAT

Student entrance to universities (local or international) requires the students to achieve scores that are based on 60% from SAT scores and 40% from school course work. The school provides intensive and professional SAT classes beginning grade 10 to prepare students to tackle SAT exams and achieve the best results.
Students have 12 opportunities to sit for SAT I and SAT II Subject Exams throughout grades 11 and 12. Students begin extensive SAT Preparation in grade 10 and continue with assistance from school through grade 12.
To be granted admission to any institute of higher learning in Egypt, students must receive a total minimum score of 1200 on the SAT for private universities, and 1490 for public universities. Students graduation scores are calculated by taking 40% of the top 8 marks received in grade 10 (max. of 1 grade), grade 11 (max. of 3 grades) and grade12 (min. of 5 grades), and 60% of the SAT score. Some universities also give a 15% bonus for SAT II examinations taken (must have a total score of over 1000 on two exams).
The only SAT II examinations recognized in Egypt are math level I and II, biology, chemistry, and physics. Passing marks and subject requirements are subject to change based on Egyptian Ministry of Education and university requirements. Individual consulting is conducted throughout the year with students and parents to estimate students’ graduation results and provide counseling with regard to university choices.
EAIS offers SAT registration help. More information will be provided from the high school GDS.",,"&#13;

The school seeks to influence Egypt’s future by producing graduates whose moral and intellectual excellence and consummate abilities will make them highly sought for roles in shaping Egypt’s place in the world.
Students of Heritage International School will be citizens of the world. They will have well-formed networks of friends and associates throughout the world. They will be grounded in the Egyptian view of the world and will also be conversant with Manitoba history, arts, and intellectual attainment, especially as found in Canada. They will be poised and effective in their dealings with North America. While remaining Egyptian in their personalities and deepest loyalties, they will nevertheless have sensitivity to and appreciation for cultures, customs, and peoples that are very different from Egypt’s.
The school asks much of its students and their families in terms of effort, time, and tuition. In return, it provides a place of deep commitment to learning, where the lifelong skills of understanding, personal and public expression, computation, problem solving, cooperation, and imagination are acquired, nurtured, and refined. The Manitoba native speaking faculty endeavors to teach a curriculum that meets Egyptian educational standards squarely while simultaneously engaging students in the exploratory, open thinking that is characteristic of Manitoba pedagogy. While English is the school’s official language of learning, it is helped along by the powerful tools that computers provide for accessing, organizing, and distributing information as part of learning.
To rear its students in this kind of school climate, where learning is paramount and understanding prized, enabling them to emerge into a wide and challenging world and assert Egypt ‘s leadership in the world is the mission of Heritage International School.

		
	

	
		
			     Our Values 
The values the school carries out in order to be true to its mission and to achieve its goals are:

Student-Centeredness: In all parts of the school and among all who are employed by it, there is a keen, continuous interest in the personal well being and highest possible achievement of each student. For this reason, the teacher-to-student ratio is a generous one, never more than 25 students per classroom.


Openness to experimentation and change: Consistent with Heritage International School’s official designation as a Manitoba curriculum school, there is an institution-wide orientation to always doing a better job. This requires reflection, study, and alertness to new ways of doing things and a willingness to change one’s ways in order to perform at a higher level.


Reasoned and respectful argument: As a community, Heritage International School depends heavily on its faculty and staff, students, parents, and educational officials, scholars, and consultants to be sources of insight, wisdom, and new ideas to guide it. It expects that they will cast a critical eye on its policies and practices and will provide helpful recommendations, suggestions, and proposals for improvement. To be most effective, such advice will be offered in civil, respectful tones and be reason-giving.","    The campus includes the following facilities:
Heritage International School is going under continuous development. The main building that comprises the Kindergarten to grade 9 classes is considered to be phase 1 of construction.
Phase 2 is being built at the moment and will comprise the school’s indoor theatre and extra classrooms expected to be used in Academic Year 2019-2020.

Our American Curriculum is followed by using American textbooks and International resources. All courses are designed to allow students maximum application of topics developing their personalities, creativity, logical, analytical and critical thinking.
In addition to a full course load, students are also given intense preparation for the SAT examination, giving them the full qualifications to apply to both local and international universities.
In addition to continuous assessment the school administers two Mid-Semester Exams and 2 Semester examinations per year. Additionally, the MAP (Measured Academic Progress) Test is administered to all our students from grades 2 to 10- two times a year (fall/ spring) to assess their performance against their peers as well as their progress throughout the year.

Grading Students are graded based on various forms of assessment, class participation, homework, classwork, projects, and behavior. EAIS believes in a well rounded student and gives a variety of opportunities to allow students to shine.

Academic Support Teachers and administrators will convene on a regular basis to determine students who need to be placed on an academic support program. These students will be closely monitored as well as given additional extra help in the subjects needed.

Promotion to the Next Grade Level Students must receive a passing grade of 60% (D-) or higher in all subjects in order to be promoted to the next grade level. Arabic, Religion, and Arabic Social Studies passing grades are from 50% as per the Ministry.
A grade of F in 1 or 2 subjects will result in a re-exam in the subjects failed. The date of the re-exam will be determined by the school administration and cannot be rescheduled. Failure to attend re-examination will result in a grade of F. Passing the re-exam will result in a passing mark of 60% (D-). Failing the re-exam will result in an F.
A grade of F in 3 or more subjects will result in the repetition of the year. 

Graduation Requirements &amp; the SAT

Student entrance to universities (local or international) requires the students to achieve scores that are based on 60% from SAT scores and 40% from school course work. The school provides intensive and professional SAT classes beginning grade 10 to prepare students to tackle SAT exams and achieve the best results.
Students have 12 opportunities to sit for SAT I and SAT II Subject Exams throughout grades 11 and 12. Students begin extensive SAT Preparation in grade 10 and continue with assistance from school through grade 12.
To be granted admission to any institute of higher learning in Egypt, students must receive a total minimum score of 1200 on the SAT for private universities, and 1490 for public universities. Students graduation scores are calculated by taking 40% of the top 8 marks received in grade 10 (max. of 1 grade), grade 11 (max. of 3 grades) and grade12 (min. of 5 grades), and 60% of the SAT score. Some universities also give a 15% bonus for SAT II examinations taken (must have a total score of over 1000 on two exams).
The only SAT II examinations recognized in Egypt are math level I and II, biology, chemistry, and physics. Passing marks and subject requirements are subject to change based on Egyptian Ministry of Education and university requirements. Individual consulting is conducted throughout the year with students and parents to estimate students’ graduation results and provide counseling with regard to university choices.
