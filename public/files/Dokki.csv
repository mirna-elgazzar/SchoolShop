&#13;
    To cope with the present international condition, and to have our up-coming generations well equipped for &#13;
their future lives  on this planet, new horizons have to be introduced into their educations that promote the &#13;
awareness and understanding of other global cultures. Students that are introduced to versatile cultures not &#13;
only learn how to understand and sympathize with them but also learn how to become tolerant towards people &#13;
who differ in traditions, customs,and priorities in life. &#13;
&#13;
    If human beings all over the world understood each other through culture understanding this world would be &#13;
far much better place to live in. It is also worth mentioning that students who are introduced to versatile cultures&#13;
have a better understanding of human nature and learn that there are more than one way to see the world and that&#13;
they all correct if seen through their own context.&#13;
&#13;
    To meet all the above mentioned demands of our present day world, Victory College in Maadi has introduced &#13;
The American International System of Education in which students will be introduced to the American culture &#13;
and way of thinking while still maintaining their faith in their native one.&#13;
