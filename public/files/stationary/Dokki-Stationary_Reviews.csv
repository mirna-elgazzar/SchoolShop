Samir & Aly Stationary House,Noga From Egypt,"One of the best stationaries, and it's big advantage is that it has a branch in almost every city, so you can only search on your google map for the nearest branch. They have almost everything but most of their stuff prices are sky rockets high especially if they are imported but you can ask for alternatives manufactured by the Samir & Aly specifically for the engineering tools as their prices are not reasonable at all. But make sure not to ask the cashiers as they don't know and they propably diss you off, you need to ask the girls in the specified section, they are very informative and helpful most of the times :)",5,en,3 months ago

Volume 1,Roxanne Christer,This doesn't have as good a range as Bakier (a few doors away) in terms of stationary but it does have a good range of cards and wrapping paper though not really and better than Cow (also a few doors away). The selection of books in the bookshop is okay though not great and likewise the prices too are okay though not great. The staff I encountered upstairs however were rude and overcharged me compared to what the pricetag said and would not accept they were wrong. I would not have completed my purchase if I'd had anything else to read on my flight.,3,en,3 months ago
Volume 1,Roxanne Astra,Not at all impressed. Was blatantly overcharged for the book that I bought. Apparently this sticker says 100LE. I did challenge them on it and they said that no it was 100LE.
