The school is a co-educational school that serves grades Pre-Kindergarten through Secondary. There are three different educational systems in the school: the National Division, the British Division and the American Division. The British Division is from years 1 to 12, the American Division, which was first established in September 2001 serves Pre-K through Grade 12.
Our Vision is to build self confident, creative leaders who communicate effectively, think critically and accept others, while maintaining a strong Egyptian identity.

		
	

		
			To provide a high quality comprehensive educational system that enables students to function as a member of a group and as a productive member of the society.
We encourage the individual freedom of the students within the boundaries of our cultural traditions and beliefs.
We encourage positive relationships and mutual respect among and between students and staff so that students learn with passion, act with integrity and serve with respect.
We teach students that they are responsible for their own actions and will be held accountable for their choices.
We create awareness of duties, responsibilities and rights.
We build characters capable of facing challenges with strong decision making skills.
We encourage consistent positive contribution through team work.
We encourage the use of technology and scientific thinking in development and planning.
Extracurricular activities play an important role to enhance the students’ soft skills, general interests and cultural awareness.

		
	

		
			The Modern Education American School received an overwhelmingly positive overall assessment in its third periodic accreditation from AdvancED in May 2012. The school received the highest rating “Highly Functional” in 5 out of 7 standards,and for the other two standards the school was rated as “Operational” which is the second best rating.
These high ratings are awarded to very few schools worldwide. The qualifying team was impressed with the school’s high quality of education, as well as its strong culture.
It is worth mentioning that MES received its first AdvanceED accreditation (known as CITA at that time) in August 2001 and Again in May 2007 as part of the customary accreditation review process every 5 years.

		
	

		
			Founder PTA members have always been of great support to MES. We involve and consult them in major decisions. We urge interested parents to step up and become active PTA members. Any support you give to the school is in fact a support to your kids.
PTA members are the ambassadors of the school; the link between parents and the school, the school and the community at large. PTA elections are held during the first month of the academic year, meetings are held regularly throughout the year.",,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,

History / Profile

The Promise of a Good EducationThe Egyptian American International School (EAIS) – the American Division of the Egyptian Language School (ELS) – was first accredited in 2003 and holds accreditation from NCA-CASI, a division of Advanc-Ed.
Since its birth EAIS has followed the ELS mission “teach for life” to prepare students for higher education, employment, and beyond. In each grade level from KG1 through grade 12, our teachers advise, assist, monitor, and motivate our students. The faculty is comprised of dedicated and professional qualified American and foreign teachers.

Curriculum &amp; Assessment The curriculum throughout the stages is based on US National Standards in association with Egyptian National Standards in Science and Math. Our American Curriculum is followed by using American textbooks and International resources. All courses are designed to allow students maximum application of topics developing their personalities, creativity, logical, analytical and critical thinking.
In addition to a full course load, students are also given intense preparation for the SAT examination, giving them the full qualifications to apply to both local and international universities.
In addition to continuous assessment the school administers two Mid-Semester Exams and 2 Semester examinations per year. Additionally, the MAP (Measured Academic Progress) Test is administered to all our students from grades 2 to 10- two times a year (fall/ spring) to assess their performance against their peers as well as their progress throughout the year.

Grading Students are graded based on various forms of assessment, class participation, homework, classwork, projects, and behavior. EAIS believes in a well rounded student and gives a variety of opportunities to allow students to shine.

Academic Support Teachers and administrators will convene on a regular basis to determine students who need to be placed on an academic support program. These students will be closely monitored as well as given additional extra help in the subjects needed.

Promotion to the Next Grade Level Students must receive a passing grade of 60% (D-) or higher in all subjects in order to be promoted to the next grade level. Arabic, Religion, and Arabic Social Studies passing grades are from 50% as per the Ministry.
A grade of F in 1 or 2 subjects will result in a re-exam in the subjects failed. The date of the re-exam will be determined by the school administration and cannot be rescheduled. Failure to attend re-examination will result in a grade of F. Passing the re-exam will result in a passing mark of 60% (D-). Failing the re-exam will result in an F.
A grade of F in 3 or more subjects will result in the repetition of the year. 

Graduation Requirements &amp; the SAT

Student entrance to universities (local or international) requires the students to achieve scores that are based on 60% from SAT scores and 40% from school course work. The school provides intensive and professional SAT classes beginning grade 10 to prepare students to tackle SAT exams and achieve the best results.
Students have 12 opportunities to sit for SAT I and SAT II Subject Exams throughout grades 11 and 12. Students begin extensive SAT Preparation in grade 10 and continue with assistance from school through grade 12.
To be granted admission to any institute of higher learning in Egypt, students must receive a total minimum score of 1200 on the SAT for private universities, and 1490 for public universities. Students graduation scores are calculated by taking 40% of the top 8 marks received in grade 10 (max. of 1 grade), grade 11 (max. of 3 grades) and grade12 (min. of 5 grades), and 60% of the SAT score. Some universities also give a 15% bonus for SAT II examinations taken (must have a total score of over 1000 on two exams).
The only SAT II examinations recognized in Egypt are math level I and II, biology, chemistry, and physics. Passing marks and subject requirements are subject to change based on Egyptian Ministry of Education and university requirements. Individual consulting is conducted throughout the year with students and parents to estimate students’ graduation results and provide counseling with regard to university choices.
EAIS offers SAT registration help. More information will be provided from the high school GDS.",,"&#13;
