History / Profile

The Promise of a Good EducationThe Egyptian American International School (EAIS) – the American Division of the Egyptian Language School (ELS) – was first accredited in 2003 and holds accreditation from NCA-CASI, a division of Advanc-Ed.
Since its birth EAIS has followed the ELS mission “teach for life” to prepare students for higher education, employment, and beyond. In each grade level from KG1 through grade 12, our teachers advise, assist, monitor, and motivate our students. The faculty is comprised of dedicated and professional qualified American and foreign teachers.

Curriculum &amp; Assessment The curriculum throughout the stages is based on US National Standards in association with Egyptian National Standards in Science and Math. Our American Curriculum is followed by using American textbooks and International resources. All courses are designed to allow students maximum application of topics developing their personalities, creativity, logical, analytical and critical thinking.
In addition to a full course load, students are also given intense preparation for the SAT examination, giving them the full qualifications to apply to both local and international universities.
In addition to continuous assessment the school administers two Mid-Semester Exams and 2 Semester examinations per year. Additionally, the MAP (Measured Academic Progress) Test is administered to all our students from grades 2 to 10- two times a year (fall/ spring) to assess their performance against their peers as well as their progress throughout the year.

Grading Students are graded based on various forms of assessment, class participation, homework, classwork, projects, and behavior. EAIS believes in a well rounded student and gives a variety of opportunities to allow students to shine.

Academic Support Teachers and administrators will convene on a regular basis to determine students who need to be placed on an academic support program. These students will be closely monitored as well as given additional extra help in the subjects needed.

Promotion to the Next Grade Level Students must receive a passing grade of 60% (D-) or higher in all subjects in order to be promoted to the next grade level. Arabic, Religion, and Arabic Social Studies passing grades are from 50% as per the Ministry.
A grade of F in 1 or 2 subjects will result in a re-exam in the subjects failed. The date of the re-exam will be determined by the school administration and cannot be rescheduled. Failure to attend re-examination will result in a grade of F. Passing the re-exam will result in a passing mark of 60% (D-). Failing the re-exam will result in an F.
A grade of F in 3 or more subjects will result in the repetition of the year. 

Graduation Requirements &amp; the SAT

Student entrance to universities (local or international) requires the students to achieve scores that are based on 60% from SAT scores and 40% from school course work. The school provides intensive and professional SAT classes beginning grade 10 to prepare students to tackle SAT exams and achieve the best results.
Students have 12 opportunities to sit for SAT I and SAT II Subject Exams throughout grades 11 and 12. Students begin extensive SAT Preparation in grade 10 and continue with assistance from school through grade 12.
To be granted admission to any institute of higher learning in Egypt, students must receive a total minimum score of 1200 on the SAT for private universities, and 1490 for public universities. Students graduation scores are calculated by taking 40% of the top 8 marks received in grade 10 (max. of 1 grade), grade 11 (max. of 3 grades) and grade12 (min. of 5 grades), and 60% of the SAT score. Some universities also give a 15% bonus for SAT II examinations taken (must have a total score of over 1000 on two exams).
The only SAT II examinations recognized in Egypt are math level I and II, biology, chemistry, and physics. Passing marks and subject requirements are subject to change based on Egyptian Ministry of Education and university requirements. Individual consulting is conducted throughout the year with students and parents to estimate students’ graduation results and provide counseling with regard to university choices.
EAIS offers SAT registration help. More information will be provided from the high school GDS.",,"&#13;

					About us&#13;
					&#13;
				&#13;
					Vision&#13;
					&#13;
					We strive to provide academic excellence and the promotion of human and spiritual values in a Salesian atmosphere of joy and nurturing, giving our students the sense of belonging to a worldwide family.  We prepare them to meet the challenges of the future and become responsible stewards of Godâs creation.&#13;
					&#13;
					Mission&#13;
					&#13;
					&#13;
										We find the very reason for our existence in the integral education of children. We see each student as a unique individual who is lovingly created by God. Comprised of students, parents, Sisters, teachers and staff, our educating community is committed to serve as partners of the parents who are the first educators of their children. &#13;
					&#13;
					&#13;
						 &#13;
					 &#13;
					Salesian Method&#13;
					&#13;
					We follow Don Boscoâs educational approach of reason, values and loving kindness, which helps create a positive atmosphere of joy and friendliness coupled with a firm insistence that students demonstrate personal responsibility, discipline, academic excellence, and respect towards all of Godâs creation. &#13;
					&#13;
					&#13;
						 &#13;
					 &#13;
					 &#13;
					 &#13;
					 &#13;
					Don Bosco's System&#13;
						 &#13;
						Don Bosco called his system of education âpreventiveâ since his goal was to prevent the child from poor choices so as to reduce the need for punishment. He insisted that parents and educators use gentle firmness to reason with each child to help her choose to live by good values. (Reason â Values â Loving Kindness).&#13;
					&#13;
					&#13;
					 &#13;
					 &#13;
					What does it mean to be Salesian?&#13;
					Family spirit sums up the Salesian philosophy of education. Our founders, Don Bosco and Mary Mazzarello, focused their energies on helping young people feel the love of God through their educators. Their secret was to form a family unit with the young, using a discipline of respect and gentle firmness that helped the child correct unacceptable ways of behavior while still maintaining her dignity. &#13;
&#13;
Salesian spirituality is both simple and practical. Don Bosco taught young people to please God by always being joyful. Mary Mazzarello would tell the girls to âdo the right thing, at the right time, and only for the love of God.â Working in their own spheres yet focused on the same goals, these two helped thousands of children to achieve a profound sense of human and spiritual maturity. Following in their footsteps, we too, work to educate the whole child, preparing her for the future through academic strength, spiritual acuity, and human goodness.&#13;

					Talent Development&#13;
					&#13;
					Students are encouraged to develop their talents through &#13;
					various competitions at the zone and city level sponsored by &#13;
					the Ministry of Education. In home economics, students learn &#13;
					handiwork and make projects to display for the school to &#13;
					see. Students can also demonstrate their talent at the &#13;
					Talent Show each year gaining courage from the warm &#13;
					acceptance of their friends.&#13;
					&#13;
					Service Projects&#13;
					&#13;
					Few things help us mature as much as giving service. From &#13;
					meeting the needy, the girls learn gratitude to God and &#13;
					their parents for all they have given them. They open their &#13;
					minds to the reality of our world and learn what is &#13;
					essential in life. They discover the joy of self-giving &#13;
					through various initiatives: Christmas bazaar to benefit the &#13;
					poor, collection for the needy orphans, and respectful &#13;
					attention to the workers at school. Each summer the girls &#13;
					finishing their first and second years of secondary &#13;
					volunteer to be counselors at Day Camp. Here they give their &#13;
					time and energy to care for the younger girls and form a &#13;
					bond with them like that of big sisters. Together, they make &#13;
					the family spirit grow stronger in the school community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
										Competitions&#13;
					&#13;
					The students participate in a variety of competitions with &#13;
					other schools, including academic, in English and Arabic, &#13;
					drama and sports. Students usually excel in these &#13;
					competitions and go on to compete at higher levels. Within &#13;
					school we also have art and talent contests. The spirit of &#13;
					competition is always friendly and gives the girls incentive &#13;
					to do well.&#13;
