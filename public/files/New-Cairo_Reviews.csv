The American International School in Egypt,Shereif Barakat,"Honestly, like any other school there are a lot of annoying things about the school. Annoying rules, annoying members of the administration, annoying teachers etc. But putting aside those differences, this is without a shadow of a doubt one of the top three schools in the country (this is coming from an alumni of the school). Your children will be taught by international professionals, raised and taught in a high class, open-minded, and cultured community. There will be certain teachers in their path to graduation that will positively influence their educational lifestyle. And all in all, they will be more ready for the world than most Egyptians. One issue is some graduates might be more ready for the world abroad but less ready for Egypt due to the western style of schooling they're raised into. In a situation like this, the parents are responsible for nurturing their kid's Egyptian identity.",5,en,10 months ago

New Cairo British International School,Asseel Darwish,"Amazing!! One of the best schools I have ever been to. If you are unsure about whether or not to go there; don't be! That school has done endless amounts for me both as a person - as it has build up my confidence immensely - and academically as it has a superb set of staff members. I cannot thank each and everyone of my teachers enough from M.r Thorne, to the very thoughtful Miss Reddy, to Mr O'Neil, to Miss Gilchrist, to Miss Belal, to the incredible and very knowledgeable Miss Birch, the very helpful Mr Tonkinson and the incredible Mr Watson ( who gave up many of his lunch breaks for me and knew exactly how to teach to the specification but in a fun and humorous way always!!) 

My teachers and time at NCBIS has simply been the best; and trust me when I say I am not overselling them!  The supporting staff are of an unparalleled calabour( the amazing Miss Noha who helped me greatly through my time in NCBIS, and the lovely lost and found person who found my glasses maybe 3 times and looked for my phone only to find that it was actually buried deep in my backpack!) I come across as very intelligent, I know!

Last but not least, I would like to give the biggest thank you to the headmaster M.r Hurrell who has stood by my family and I since I set foot into NCBIS!

Many thanks to everyone in the NCBIS community for helping me achieve my academic and personal goals. This school is truly an unforgettable chapter in my life!",5,en,8 months ago

Modern Schools of Egypt 2000,Chicken 123,"This school is the worst. There are teachers who are ignorant to the children and allow bullying and do not care for what the students say. My experience started when I first applied and started the first day of school. I, as most kindergarten children would do, cried when my father left. My sister came to comfort me a little yet the teacher yelled at her so much without listening and even made my sister who was in 2nd grade cry. Keep in mind this is a kindergarten teacher. At lunch, I had my purple barney lunch box ready to be eaten and this child came and stole it. I tried to tell a teacher yet she just kept on chatting with a fellow teacher. She did not even look in my direction. I did not eat that lunch. I would never recommend this school for any self respecting parent.

Cairo Modern International School- CMIS,Ahmed Raafat Mahmoud Gad ElRab,"Very good school in terms of facilities, classes capacity and overall building condition.

Classes are between 15-20 students, air conditioned and equipped with smart boards.

There's swimming pool, tennis court, volleyball court and ballet studio.

I believe that in general I'd give it 7/10 cause they really need to focus on the quality of their teachers and administrators. Additionally, I see a great opportunity on the publicity front.

School's management should have taken good care of marketing for their school which would have automatically increased the number of the applicants and consequently, enabled them from choosing higher quality/standard students.

Needless to say that by default islamic ""extremists"" are in love with ""girls only"" slogan which put a lot of pressure on the management to filter these applicants. 

This's why my advice to management is to expand the pool via good advertising",4,en,6 months ago
