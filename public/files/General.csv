Through its distinctive trilingual education, GVS provides its students with the tool needed to challenge convention and to establish new benchmarks which allow students to be part of a world with no limits.
For a child, learning a second or a third language is not more difficult than learning just one. Learning new languages at young ages is greatly beneficial not only because of the children’s receptivity to such but also because of how languages differ from each other. This further boosts the child’s understanding of these languages. Learning German alongside English,the child’s understanding and appreciation of German is further enhanced.
Other benefits of learning three languages simultaneously are vast; Children’s creative thinking skills and cognitive flexibility are developed dramatically; traits that GVS finds particularly important.
Through the study of these languages, students are exposed and asked to master different contexts of communication. They are required to do so at a regular basis and this develops their communication skills considerably. Bilingual/Trilingual teaching will also stimulate a child’s urge to expose oneself to diverse and discomfort experiences.
In addition, a multilingual environment exposes a child to a variety of unlike cultures. He will be exposed to unusual perspectives and ways of thinking and will come to truly appreciate his home culture. These endeavors inspire our vision:
“TO BECOME AN AUTHENTIC TRILINGUAL SCHOOL”
This vision has shaped the education provided by the school since it was founded. It is a vision that continues to dictate every aspect of school life today. Arabic, English and German are taught in parallel. Every effort is made to develop students’ sensitivity and fluency in these languages and to ensure that they receive full benefit from their extensive linguistic education. The quest for our vision continues…!",,,,,1,0,1,0,0,

History / Profile

The Promise of a Good EducationThe Egyptian American International School (EAIS) – the American Division of the Egyptian Language School (ELS) – was first accredited in 2003 and holds accreditation from NCA-CASI, a division of Advanc-Ed.
Since its birth EAIS has followed the ELS mission “teach for life” to prepare students for higher education, employment, and beyond. In each grade level from KG1 through grade 12, our teachers advise, assist, monitor, and motivate our students. The faculty is comprised of dedicated and professional qualified American and foreign teachers.

Curriculum &amp; Assessment The curriculum throughout the stages is based on US National Standards in association with Egyptian National Standards in Science and Math. Our American Curriculum is followed by using American textbooks and International resources. All courses are designed to allow students maximum application of topics developing their personalities, creativity, logical, analytical and critical thinking.
In addition to a full course load, students are also given intense preparation for the SAT examination, giving them the full qualifications to apply to both local and international universities.
In addition to continuous assessment the school administers two Mid-Semester Exams and 2 Semester examinations per year. Additionally, the MAP (Measured Academic Progress) Test is administered to all our students from grades 2 to 10- two times a year (fall/ spring) to assess their performance against their peers as well as their progress throughout the year.

Grading Students are graded based on various forms of assessment, class participation, homework, classwork, projects, and behavior. EAIS believes in a well rounded student and gives a variety of opportunities to allow students to shine.

Academic Support Teachers and administrators will convene on a regular basis to determine students who need to be placed on an academic support program. These students will be closely monitored as well as given additional extra help in the subjects needed.

Promotion to the Next Grade Level Students must receive a passing grade of 60% (D-) or higher in all subjects in order to be promoted to the next grade level. Arabic, Religion, and Arabic Social Studies passing grades are from 50% as per the Ministry.
A grade of F in 1 or 2 subjects will result in a re-exam in the subjects failed. The date of the re-exam will be determined by the school administration and cannot be rescheduled. Failure to attend re-examination will result in a grade of F. Passing the re-exam will result in a passing mark of 60% (D-). Failing the re-exam will result in an F.
A grade of F in 3 or more subjects will result in the repetition of the year. 

Graduation Requirements &amp; the SAT

Student entrance to universities (local or international) requires the students to achieve scores that are based on 60% from SAT scores and 40% from school course work. The school provides intensive and professional SAT classes beginning grade 10 to prepare students to tackle SAT exams and achieve the best results.
Students have 12 opportunities to sit for SAT I and SAT II Subject Exams throughout grades 11 and 12. Students begin extensive SAT Preparation in grade 10 and continue with assistance from school through grade 12.
To be granted admission to any institute of higher learning in Egypt, students must receive a total minimum score of 1200 on the SAT for private universities, and 1490 for public universities. Students graduation scores are calculated by taking 40% of the top 8 marks received in grade 10 (max. of 1 grade), grade 11 (max. of 3 grades) and grade12 (min. of 5 grades), and 60% of the SAT score. Some universities also give a 15% bonus for SAT II examinations taken (must have a total score of over 1000 on two exams).
The only SAT II examinations recognized in Egypt are math level I and II, biology, chemistry, and physics. Passing marks and subject requirements are subject to change based on Egyptian Ministry of Education and university requirements. Individual consulting is conducted throughout the year with students and parents to estimate students’ graduation results and provide counseling with regard to university choices.
EAIS offers SAT registration help. More information will be provided from the high school GDS.",,,"&#13;

BCCIS opened its doors to 27 students and their families in September 2005. Since then, we have multiplied to a community of 800 students and over 100 staff members. Our small beginning was five classes across the school, from preschool to Grade 6; now, we hold over forty classes from Preschool to Grade 12. Early on, our Early Child Education (ECE) department, which hosts Preschool and Kindergarten 1, has outgrown us and moved on to their own peaceful quarters adjacent to the main building. Following in their footsteps was the Kindergarten 2 stage, also moving on to their own haven and slowly allowing the young students to transition to the ‘big school’.

Every year, our graduating classes continue to make us proud by moving on to higher education and taking all they learned and have become at BCCIS around the world. We have the pleasure to open our doors to our alumni students who continually return to visit the home they left behind at BCCIS.

BCCIS was started by a family and family values remain the core of our philosophy. From the groundkeepers to the graduating senior to the BC teacher from Vancouver, we are all one, and we all share a home at BCCIS.","BCCIS is very proud to have been fully certified by the Canadian BC Ministry of Education since 2005.  In keeping with our open and transparent approach to education, here are the certificates from 2005-2014 (click them for a closer view):",,,"Tuition fees include

It is therefore imperative for teachers and students alike to adhere to a code of conduct devised by the school. Conduct of the teachers, staff and students alike should reflect awareness of their rights and responsibilities. It is highly desirable to demonstrate politeness, courtesy and respect to each others sensitivities at all times. Self critique and soul searching is highly advisable to develop a sense of responsibility and respect for others. It is better to admit own mistakes rather than seeking to blame others.&#13;
 &#13;
Students must also realize that their conduct bears consequences. Positive actions shall be rewarded while negative or disruptive deeds would invoke penalty. Dignity and self-esteem demand mutual respect among teachers, staff and students alike. It is unacceptable to belittle, or mock or deride any person or object. Students are not allowed to leave a class without the permission of the teacher, or miss an extra-curricular activity.&#13;
 &#13;
Teachers must be diligent in making proper plans and arrangements for extra practices, or excursions and study tours in cooperation with the school management. All teachers and staff members are expected to be on time for school, classes and meetings. Tardiness shall be deemed highly negative. It is acceptable for teachers to trade lessons to facilitate trips etc.&#13;
 &#13;
Corporal punishment or bullying is strictly forbidden by anyone, for any reason, in the school. Any student found to be bullying will be reprimanded and disciplined. It is unacceptable whether it happens in school, out of school, online, during activities or trips or on the school buses. Assault, harassment, intimidation, mortification, or taunts to anyone would invoke disciplinary action. Rumour mongering or an orchestrated campaign of shunning would also invoke disciplinary action. &#13;
 &#13;
Each teacher is responsible for discipline in his/her own classroom. Teachers may use temporary exclusion from class, extra work, or Break detention. Teachers who give students a Break detention must allow the student time to go to bathroom and to eat their food and the students must be supervised in detention. A student who continues to misbehave can then be referred to the Head of Department for further support. After school detention may only be used after the parents have been notified and given approval through a signed note that indicates that they realize that they must arrange transport home.&#13;
 &#13;
The Principal should be the last resort of discipline so that he/she retains an aura of severity and a sense of the seriousness of the infraction. Serious breaches of discipline, or prolonged minor breaches, should be recorded on the student’s file. This file will provide the necessary evidence if suspension or expulsion are considered.&#13;
 &#13;
Parents should be involved in persistent disciplinary problems. The school must be provided an emergency day time number to be called in case where a student becomes ill or gets injured per chance. In an emergency the school Nurse shall offer first aid to the student before the parents/guardians can be contacted. Any special instructions in this regard must be notified in writing to the school at the time of admission.",,"The annual registration/admissions are finalised during the summer vacation. The schoolalso accepts new admissions at the beginning of each term provided a place is available inthe required class. Parents may register their children on a working day, i.e. Sunday toThursday. Admission is strictly on merit i.e. performance in the admission test andinterviews conducted on any of the school’s working days.&#13;
