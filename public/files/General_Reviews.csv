The American International School in Egypt,Shereif Barakat,"Honestly, like any other school there are a lot of annoying things about the school. Annoying rules, annoying members of the administration, annoying teachers etc. But putting aside those differences, this is without a shadow of a doubt one of the top three schools in the country (this is coming from an alumni of the school). Your children will be taught by international professionals, raised and taught in a high class, open-minded, and cultured community. There will be certain teachers in their path to graduation that will positively influence their educational lifestyle. And all in all, they will be more ready for the world than most Egyptians. One issue is some graduates might be more ready for the world abroad but less ready for Egypt due to the western style of schooling they're raised into. In a situation like this, the parents are responsible for nurturing their kid's Egyptian identity.",5,en,10 months ago

Modern Schools of Egypt 2000,Chicken 123,"This school is the worst. There are teachers who are ignorant to the children and allow bullying and do not care for what the students say. My experience started when I first applied and started the first day of school. I, as most kindergarten children would do, cried when my father left. My sister came to comfort me a little yet the teacher yelled at her so much without listening and even made my sister who was in 2nd grade cry. Keep in mind this is a kindergarten teacher. At lunch, I had my purple barney lunch box ready to be eaten and this child came and stole it. I tried to tell a teacher yet she just kept on chatting with a fellow teacher. She did not even look in my direction. I did not eat that lunch. I would never recommend this school for any self respecting parent. If you are considering to send your children to this god-awful place, reconsider for the good of your children.",1,en,3 months ago

Modern Schools of Egypt 2000,Catherine Miller,"Words Can not explain how horrible and unprofessional this school is especially from a working standpoint!  If you want to implement an American Curriculum, you also need to treat your employees and students like the American schools. You can not have an American curriculum and implement Egyptian rules behind it. You're not getting your money's worth in this education system. I am American and came from America to work here and it was the most horrible experience. I feel bad for the students who attend this school.",1,en,6 months ago

Air conditioners are generally impaired due to lack of maintainence , Buses lack A.C , and teachers are apparently escaping from the school , particularly the American Section. It also offers little to no care about some academic subjects although the books and curriculums are standard. If you are able to afford more expensive schools, I strongly advice to enlist your children there.",2,en,a year ago

They will call you if your kid talk in class .. if he/she went more than once to toilet.. had an argue with any kid.. or doesn't even understand in class ! Building and facilities are good but the service is horrible.  Unqualified teachers with zero skills to handle kids. Curicullim is very weak .. academically very weak.

New Cairo British International School,Asseel Darwish,"Amazing!! One of the best schools I have ever been to. If you are unsure about whether or not to go there; don't be! That school has done endless amounts for me both as a person - as it has build up my confidence immensely - and academically as it has a superb set of staff members. I cannot thank each and everyone of my teachers enough from M.r Thorne, to the very thoughtful Miss Reddy, to Mr O'Neil, to Miss Gilchrist, to Miss Belal, to the incredible and very knowledgeable Miss Birch, the very helpful Mr Tonkinson and the incredible Mr Watson ( who gave up many of his lunch breaks for me and knew exactly how to teach to the specification but in a fun and humorous way always!!) 

My teachers and time at NCBIS has simply been the best; and trust me when I say I am not overselling them!  The supporting staff are of an unparalleled calabour( the amazing Miss Noha who helped me greatly through my time in NCBIS, and the lovely lost and found person who found my glasses maybe 3 times and looked for my phone only to find that it was actually buried deep in my backpack!) I come across as very intelligent, I know!

Last but not least, I would like to give the biggest thank you to the headmaster M.r Hurrell who has stood by my family and I since I set foot into NCBIS!

Many thanks to everyone in the NCBIS community for helping me achieve my academic and personal goals. This school is truly an unforgettable chapter in my life!",5,en,8 months ago

"The British International School, Cairo",Omar Hussein,Bisc used to be a good school. If you want any proof of this notice how poorly written the other reviews are. As a former student I can say that at one point every single teacher was British. Now its all Spanish (even the principal) or other ESL speakers because they cost less. If you want the best ask the British Embassy where they recommend British teachers to teach. As of about a decade Bisc has not been on that list.,2,en,2 months ago

Bisc also have dedicated classrooms such as ICT, Science and PE. Speaking of PE the school provides excellent sport facilities such as tennis courts, an Olympic sized swimming pool, two football courts and a basket ball court. They offer Foreign Trips for both sports and educational, These trips are very memorable and fun. If you are planning on moving to Cairo I highly recommended this school.
